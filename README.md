# The Monkees #

I created a website for the band The Monkees.  The website consists of the landing page and 5 additional pages made up of:
* About
* Booking Events
* Contact Us
* Music Videos
* Events 

The idea of the landing page is to have a scrolling menu with a fixed menu navbar at the top.  This navbar also shows at the top of every other page as it makes
for easy navigation throughout the whole website.  When scrolling down the landing page, each section mentioned above is represented
by a seperate clickable menu item.  These menu items were designed using photo's of the band with overlay text.  At the bottom of each page there are links to the bands facebook,
youtube and twitter.

As this is my first ever project I wanted to do as much of the website from scratch, rather than just copying code from other websites.  Of course the standard HTML and CSS code were used.
In this case Bootstrap v3.3.7 was used.

## User Experience ##
The Monkees is a well known band to the older generation of music lovers.  They have a number of golden oldies and are still big favourites of an older generation.
Because of this I wanted to create a website that is easy to use, easy to see and read, and simple to understand.  I wanted to make it easy for users of the page to navigate from anywhere to anywhere.
The landing page has very large clickalbe main menu items and provides access to The Monkees' social media at the bottom of each page.
I've given fans of The Monkees the ability to read more about the band and see the faces of the band members, book the band for an event, easily see where the band will be playing next,
and also the ability for them to contact the band.  

For instance:

* As a fan of The Monkees and a keen concert goer I want to see where the band is going to perform next.  I access the website, scrool down to "Events", click on "Events", and the user is taken to a calendar 
  showing all of the events coming up.
* As someone doing research on the band I'd like to know more about them.  I access the website, click on About and viola.  From knowing more about the band I would like to contact them therefore
* I click on the "Contact Us" menu item at the top of the "About" page where it takes me directly to the "Contact Us" page.  There the user will fill in their details and click submit.
* Not having had a lot of exposure to video material of the band as a massive fan I'd like to access some of their music videos.  I access the website, click on "Music Videos" of which I'm taken to the "Music Videos" page.  There I am presented with four album covers representing four of The Monkees' most popular songs.  
  By clicking on each of the album covers I'm taken to YouTube where the music video of that specific song automatically starts playing.

## Features ##

### Landing Page ###

The landing page is made up of six individual menu items.  The landing page has been designed as a scrolling page for easy access to the main menu items further down on the page.
Photos from Google have been used to represent each of the main menu items on the landing page.  The menu has been divided as follows:
About and Events 
Music videos, Book Events, and Contact Us

At the bottom of the page there are three clickable social media icons for Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube which will take you directly to each of these social pages.

At the top of the landing page is a static menu.  This has been included to make navigation to other areas on the website as easy and user friendly as possible.

### About Page ###

The "About" page has been created to provide historical backgroun on the band.  There are also photos of the band members at the bottom of the page.
There are no special features on this page.  As with everyone of the other pages there is a static menu bar at the top of the page for easy navigation.
There's also the three social media icons at the bottom of the page.




Existing Features

...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
